	abstract = {This essay utilizes the perspective of articulation theory to examine how environmental advocates, public interest organizations, and citizen-consumers have challenged the nuclear industry's expansion efforts, linking strategies at local and global levels. The industry has articulated a material and discursive formation including reactor construction projects, financial and political arrangements, and an overarching narrative of nuclear necessity and inevitability. Opponents have responded by linking organizations, individuals, histories, geographies, and expertise, re-articulating the place of nuclear power in the field of energy choices. This essay examines those opposing articulations in the context of efforts to construct new nuclear power plants in the southeastern USA. There, opponents have challenged state-level regulatory approval of a corporate merger that would facilitate new nuclear construction and financing arrangements that would shift economic risks from the corporation to consumers. These local engagements have broader consequences: in challenging one corporation's nuclear ambitions, opponents also challenge the global industry narrative of nuclear necessity and inevitability.},

	title = {Rooftop {Solar} {Photovoltaic} {Technical} {Potential} in the {United} {States}: {A} {Detailed} {Assessment}},
	url = {https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65298.pdf},
	abstract = {This report quantifies the technical potential of photovoltaic (PV) systems deployed on rooftops in
the continental United States, estimating how much energy could be generated by installing PV on
all suitable roof area. The results do not exclude systems based on their economic performance, and
thus they provide an upper bound on potential deployment rather than a prediction of actual
deployment.
Although methods have been developed to estimate rooftop PV technical potential at the individual
building level, previous estimates at the regional and national levels have lacked a rigorous
foundation in geospatial data and statistical analysis. This report helps fill this gap by providing a
detailed data-driven analysis of U.S. (national, state, and ZIP-code level) rooftop PV availability
and technical electricity-generation potential. First, we use light detection and ranging (lidar) data,
geographic information system (GIS) methods, and PV-generation modeling to calculate the
suitability of rooftops for hosting PV in 128 cities nationwide{\textemdash}representing approximately 23\% of
U.S. buildings{\textemdash}and we provide PV-generation results for a subset of these cities. Second, we
extend the insights from this analysis of areas covered by lidar data to the entire continental United
States. We develop two statistical models{\textemdash}one for small buildings and one for medium and large
buildings{\textemdash}that estimate the total amount of roof area suitable for hosting PV systems, and we
simulate the productivity of PV modules on the roof area to arrive at the nationwide technical
potential for PV.
Our analysis of the trends in the suitability of rooftops for hosting PV systems reveals important
variations in this key driver of rooftop PV technical potential that have not been captured by
previous approaches. Figure ES-1 shows the results{\textemdash}from our statistical modeling grounded in
lidar data{\textemdash}for the percentage of small buildings that are suitable for PV in each ZIP code in the
continental United States. In the figure we can identify regional trends in the suitability of small
building rooftops, with high densities of suitable small buildings in California, Florida, and the
West South Central census division. Such trends are also critical to estimating PV technical
potential at finer resolution, and our report illustrates this with a high-resolution analysis of 11
representative cities.
Figure ES-2 shows the annual energy generation potential from rooftop PV as a percentage of each
state{\textquoteright}s electricity sales in 2013. The estimates of energy generation are based on the rooftop
suitability of small, medium, and large buildings as well as specific roof orientations, local solar
resources, PV system performance assumptions, and building footprints.},
